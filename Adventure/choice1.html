        <h2>GO TO COLLEGE</h2>
      <p>
        It used to be a high school diploma was all you needed for most jobs – brain surgery and rocket science aside! Today, most good-paying jobs require either a college degree or specialized post-secondary training and skills development.
Over and above getting a job, there are plenty of very good reasons for furthering your education…such as improving your discipline. Furthering your education also is beneficial to career preparation. Whether you already know what you want to do, think you do, or aren’t really sure, an academic setting is a great place to explore options, expand your skills and knowledge, and train for that dream job and career. Not only that, but the more formal education or training you have, the more options you’ll uncover for increasing earning potential – always a good thing!

        Anyways, since you have already chosen to continue your education, the choices for your potential career are different compared to a person who has not chosen to further their education. In this case, your two options include becoming either a doctor or a lawyer. Now, think critically because you will most likely have this career for the rest of your life. Take your time... and do not stress yourself out so much! I know I emphasizded that this is a critical decision, but it's not the end of the world if you choose wrong. Not that there is a right or wrong choice or anything. Did I say that? Never mind, ignore me, I'm just on screen text so it doesn't really matter what my opinion is. Come on, this game is supposed to be fun. If you keep making that face you're gonna give yourself wrinkles lol. Okay, okay. Time to get serious. Choose your job before I have to choose it for you.
