        <h2>CHOOSE A JOB</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing a career might be one of the most difficult decisions you ever make and one that will impact your life the most, therefore you want to make sure that you will be happy with your decision, while also making a good living. One of the biggest mistakes that young people do is follow other people’s dreams when choosing a career. Be it parents, friends, idols, etc., they follow a path that might not necessarily fit their set of skills or personality. They go to college and study something that they are not passionate about, because “this is the future”, “it pays well”, “your father and I would be so proud”, just to find themselves 4 years later that they have a degree in something they never wished to pursue. I’ve seen it happen way too many times and, unfortunately, many people are living miserable lives because of taking the wrong decision when it comes to choosing a career.

        So, as a way of decreasing your anxiety about choosing one of two career options, which really should be pretty easy, I have curated some questions to think about that will help aid you in making your final decision. What are you passionate about? What skills do you have that will help with the jobs you have the option of pursuing? How much does each job pay? Are there any certifications required for either job? What is the environment like in the work place, do you think it is the correct space for you? What can you get out of the job if you decide to switch careers midway through? These are important questions to keep in mind while you go about deciding what job you would prefer from the other. Now, I know I didn't give you very many options, but I think you could find either one fun in their own way. And it doesn't hurt that they both pay well.
